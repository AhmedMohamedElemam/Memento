    <description>BotDetect CAPTCHA Generator protects ASP.NET forms from automated spam submissions. Highly customizable, secure and accessible Captcha protection is available for ASP.NET MVC 1-6 web applications, ASP.NET WebForms, and ASP.NET Web Pages. BotDetect works in China -- and it does not stalk you around 24/7.

BotDetect is unique among Captcha solutions by using many different image and sound algorithms for the generation  of Captcha codes. While each Captcha code algorithm is easily comprehensible to human users, generating Captcha codes by random algorithm makes the Captcha challenge practically impossible to pass automatically. This approach to Captcha security is validated by the BotDetect track record: we have over 3000 paying customers and not one confirmed case of automated Captcha breaking by spammers.
    
BotDetect provides an audio Captcha alternative to keep ASP.NET web applications accessible to the blind and other people for whom reading the Captcha code could be a problem, enabling you to make WCAG and Section 508 compliant websites.

What nuget to use?
--------------------
Please note that from the version 4.2 onward we will have two BotDetect CAPTCHA nugets on the nuget.org.
	* Use THIS nuget for ASP.NET applications running on the legacy .NET (non-Core) Frameworks
	* Use THIS nuget for ASP.NET Core applications running on the .NET Core Frameworks -- from the BotDetect 4.3 onward
However, there is one special case that required the separate nuget.
  * Use our NEW helper nuget INSTEAD OF this one for the special case of ASP.NET Core applications running on the legacy .NET (non-Core) Frameworks -- this is available immediately. The new helper nuget name is CAPTCHA.asp.net.core.on.legacy.net.frameworks and it is available at https://www.nuget.org/packages/CAPTCHA.asp.net.core.on.legacy.net.frameworks/</description>
